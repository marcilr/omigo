Omigo Bidet Toilet Seat FAQ
===========================
o Is the water Omigo uses clean?
  Absolutely yes!  It uses the same fresh water as your shower
  and sink, perfectly clean for your rear, and uses a pint
  per wash.

o How do I clean my Omigo?
  Simply unplug your Omigo bidet seat and use mild detergents
  as you would your normal toilet seat.  There is a quick release
  button so you can easily pop it off for an occasional deeper
   clean.

o Do I need a plumber to install my Omigo?
  Nope!  You can DIY this install in about 20 minutes.
  We have a step-by-step video as well as detailed instructions
  online or in your bidet seat manual.

o How is Omigo powered?
  Access your average bathroom GFCI outlet to plug Omigo in,
  it's perfectly safe.  Don’t have an outlet nearby?  Use a
  properly rated extension cord, it's worth the reach.
